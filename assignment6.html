<div id="textBox"><p>I would argue that this work of art is not a Banksy. Banksy is a British graffiti artist that’s been active since the 90s, working primarily with stencils so as to work faster and not get caught. His work often tries to be anti-war, anti-establishment, or anti-capitalism. The work of art on Northeastern’s campus was actually created by Jef Aérosol, one of Banksy’s predecessors. Though his style was undoubtedly influenced by Banksy and his immense popularity, I don’t feel that it’s fair to attribute a work to someone who most likely learned from the true artist. Similarly, though the art style of the black and white stenciling looks identical to much of Banksy’s work, the subject matter does not feel as similar. While Banksy often tries to make anti-establishment points with his art, Jef Aérosol focuses more on highlighting people who would otherwise remain anonymous. A child with no shoes and a newspaper feels much more like someone we easily ignore than a statement on capitalism. To me, what makes a Banksy a Banksy is its definitive stance on a divisive issue. Seeing as this work of art sheds light on a person and not on a debate, it does not fit Banksy’s style.</p></div>
